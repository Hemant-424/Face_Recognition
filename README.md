# Face_Recognition
Face recognition with Tensorflow in Python

This is completly based on deep learning nueral network and implented using Tensorflow framework. Here you will get how to implement fastly and you can find code at github and uses is demonstrated at YouTube.

Installation Python Libraries:
Tensorflow (1.4.0)
Scipy (0.17.0)
Scikit-learn (0.19.1)
Opencv (2.4.9.1)


Usage:
Stage 1: Data Collection
-I collected the data(images) and stored in different folders with the images names
Stage 2:
-I had train the model using that training data which i stored in Different folders
Stage 3:
-This the final stage where i was predicting the image names based on my training images.

Loss Function:
-loss function is like to determine how far the predicted image deviate from the actual image in the training data. i got 100% accurate answer when i predicted the image based on my training images.
